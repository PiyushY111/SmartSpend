# expense-tracker
This is an expense tracker app I built using React. It allows users to easily log and manage their expenses, providing a simple interface for tracking income, expenses, and budgets. I focused on creating a smooth, responsive experience with real-time updates, and incorporated features like expense categorization and data visualization.

## features
- Add, edit, and delete expenses.
- View a list of all expenses.
- Display total expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, transport, entertainment).
- Filter expenses by date, category, or amount.
- Optionally, implement a user authentication system if you want persistent data.
